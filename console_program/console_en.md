## Task 1

Create a simple addition calculator that can add 
any two numbers that a user inputs.

1. The user inputs two numbers
2. The program calculates the sum
3. The program prints the sum to the console

## Task 2

Create a calculator that can 
add, subtract, multiply and divide numbers.

1. The user enters 2 numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /)
2. The program calculates the result
3. The program prints the result to the console

## Task 3

Create a program to solve quadratic equations

1. The user enters the factors of a quadratic equation: `a`, `b` and `c`
2. The program calculates the solutions
3. The program outputs the results into the console

### How to solve quadratic equations

https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/quadratic-equation.html

Quadratic equations have the following form:

![ax**2 + bx +c](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/quadratic-equation.svg)

Parameters `a`, `b` and `c` are known factors. This is what defines the equation. For example:

2x<sup>2</sup> + 5x + 3 = 0

The factors are:

    a=2
    b=5
    c=3

In order to find the solutions to a quadratic equation, use the following formula:

![x = (-b +- sqrt(b**2 - 4ac))/2a](https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/images/quadratic-formula.svg)
